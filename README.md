Health is an essential aspect of everyoneâ€™s life. Breast cancer is found in the body of male or female when the cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor and can be felt as a lump or could be seen on an x-ray. Cancer can be distinguished as benign, or either can be malignant (cancer).
